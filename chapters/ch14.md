# Model Training and Validation



# Model Performance: Training and Validation Accuracy

The model's performance was evaluated based on its accuracy on the training and validation datasets. The accuracy of the model on the training data (`accuracy`) and the validation data (`val_accuracy`) is recorded for each epoch during the training process.

The `accuracy` values represent the model's ability to correctly predict the outcome on the training data, while `val_accuracy` values represent the model's ability to generalize its predictions to unseen data (validation data).

Observing the accuracy and val_accuracy values over the epochs, we can see that the model is learning as there is a steady improvement in both the training and validation accuracies. The model starts with lower accuracies around 0.64 and improves to above 0.89 by the end of training, which indicates that the model has learned to correctly classify a high proportion of cases.

# Model Evaluation: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

In addition to accuracy, the model's performance was also evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide a more comprehensive view of the model's performance, particularly in cases where the classes are imbalanced.

- Precision is the proportion of true positive predictions (i.e., the model correctly identified a nodule) out of all positive predictions made by the model. A high precision indicates a low false positive rate. The model achieved a precision of 0.91 for class 0 and 0.86 for class 1.

- Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. A high recall indicates that the model correctly identified a large number of actual positive cases. The model achieved a recall of 0.91 for class 0 and 0.86 for class 1.

- F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both considerations. The model achieved an F1-score of 0.91 for class 0 and 0.86 for class 1.

These results indicate that the model performed well in identifying both classes, with a slight advantage in identifying class 0 (no nodule) over class 1 (nodule present). Overall, the model's performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score is commendable.
